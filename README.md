# PERMANENT_DataAnalysis
Data Analysis for PERMANENT PEM fuel cell degradation

This repository aims at sharing the .R-files for reproducable research and collaboration.
The folder 'ReversibleDegradation' includes all R-scripts to reproduce all results obtained in the paper 
'A Recursive Nonlinear Regression Model for Recoverable Degradation in PEM Fuel Cells' submitted at Environmental and Ecological Statistics.

Large data files in an folder ReversibleDegradation/data/ need to be stored locally and are ignored by git due to their large size.
For the paper 'A Recursive Nonlinear Regression Model for Recoverable Degradation in PEM Fuel Cells' by Parzer et. al., the corresponding data set can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17223247.

The folder 'AggCycles' includes all R-scripts to analyse the average currents over cycles of specific voltage profiles and investigates
its behaviour over time in ongoing research.
